# Trie

Implement the Data Structure (using classes)<br/>
• Must store the words of an input text file<br/>
• for each word (node) in the tree, a count with the
  number of repeats must also be stored<br/>
• Ensure at least insert/search methods are correctly
  implemented<br/>
• search must also return/show the count<br/>
• Generate a DOT file for visualization<br/>

What is a trie?

In computer science, a trie, also called digital tree or prefix tree, is a kind of search tree—an ordered tree data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated; i.e., the value of the key is distributed across the structure. All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node, and the root is associated with the empty string. Keys tend to be associated with leaves, though some inner nodes may correspond to keys of interest. Hence, keys are not necessarily associated with every node. For the space-optimized presentation of prefix tree, see compact prefix tree.
